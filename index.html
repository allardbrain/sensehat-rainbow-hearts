                A Raspberry Pi<br>
                A SenseHAT, connected to your Pi's GPIO pins<br>
                <strong>Either</strong> SSH access to your Pi<br>
                <strong>Or</strong> a monitor connected to your Pi with an HDMI cable<br>

            <h2>Getting Set Up</h2>
            <p>This tutorial assumes you've correctly attached the SenseHAT to your Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins. If the LEDs show a rainbow when you power on the Pi, you're all set. The tutorial also assumes that you can see your Desktop (if you're using a monitor) or Bash (if you're using SSH).</p>
        </div>  <!-- end "Getting Set Up" row -->

        <div class="row" id="content">
            <h2>Let's Do It!</h2>
            <p>From your Terminal, navigate to the Desktop. (Remember that the dollar sign ($) is part of your Terminal; you do not need to type this in.)</p>

            <div class="well well-sm">$ cd ~/Desktop</div>

            <p>Let's make a new directory to hold the Rainbow Hearts project, and then navigate into it:</p>

            <div class="well well-sm">$ mkdir pi_rainbow_hearts<br>$ cd pi_rainbow_hearts</div>

            <p>To double check that we're in the right place, we can run the 'pwd' command, which will print to our screen the file path we're currently in:</p>

            <div class="well well-sm">$ pwd <br>pi/Desktop/pi-rainbow-hearts [[[ DOUBLE CHECK THIS ]]]</div>

            <p>Now that we're in the directory for the Rainbow Hearts project, we need to create a Python file to put our code in.</p>

            <div class="well well-sm">$ touch hearts.py</div>

            <p>Let's open this file with the Raspberry Pi's built-in Python 3 IDLE, like so:</p>

            <div class="well well-sm">$ [[[ DOUBLE CHECK THIS ]]]</div>

            <p>Voila! Now we're ready to write some code! We need to import two modules: 1) The SenseHAT library, so we can interact with the SenseHAT, and 2) The Time library, so we can have our hearts flash on the LED matrix for a specified amount of time. 

            <br><br>

            Note that the # sign creates a comment in Python, and any line of code that starts with a # will not be run. Programmers use this feature to write notes about their code. Here, the note we see is just telling us which file we are in.</p>

            <div class="well well-sm">
                <em># hearts.py</em>
                <br><br>
                <span id="orange">from</span> sense_hat <span id="orange">import</span> SenseHat<br>
                <span id="orange">import</span> time
            </div>  <!-- end well -->

            <p>When we import SenseHat, as above, we are importing an "object" called SenseHat. Objects can have special functions attached to them (called "methods"), and we can use these special functions to make the objects do different things. We'll come back to this idea later. For right now, we want to save this SenseHat object as a variable so we can refer to the SenseHat object simply by using the variable name:</p>

            <div class="well well-sm">
                <em># hearts.py</em>
                <br><br>
                <span id="orange">from</span> sense_hat <span id="orange">import</span> SenseHat<br>
                <span id="orange">import</span> time
                <br><br>
                sense <span id="orange">=</span> SenseHat( )
            </div>  <!-- end well -->

            <p>Along with methods, objects can also have special characteristics which we call "attributes". For example, if we created a "Dog" object, the object might have attributes such as "breed" or "weight". We can store values inside these attributes, so in this example we could set<br> Dog.breed = "Golden Retriever"
            <br><br> 
            Let's get back to the topic of writing Python code so we can interact with our SenseHAT. The LEDs are quite bright, so to make them a little dimmer, we can change the SenseHat object's "low_light" attribute to True (the default is False), as shown below:</p>

            <div class="well well-sm">
                <em># hearts.py</em>
                <br><br>
                <span id="orange">from</span> sense_hat <span id="orange">import</span> SenseHat
                <br>
                <span id="orange">import</span> time
                <br><br>
                sense <span id="orange">=</span> SenseHat( )
                <br>
                sense.low_light <span id="orange">=</span> <span id="blue">True</span>
            </div>  <!-- end well -->

            <p><em><style>font-size="1em"</style>If the topics of objects, methods and attributes are confusing right now, don't worry! You can still have fun and complete this tutorial even if you skip the stuff about objects. Keep going!</em></p>

            <br><br>

            <p>Alright. We've taken care of importing things and setting up our SenseHat object. Time to choose some colors using the Red-Green-Blue (RGB) format!</p>


            <br><br>
            <p>RGB is a way of referring to colors which have been created by mixing very specific quantities of red, green and blue. Each color (red, green or blue) can have a quantity, or concentration, of up to 255. For example, the RGB value for red is (255, 0, 0) because we list the concentrations in (RGB) order, and pure red will have no green or blue in it. This means there's a 100% concentration of red and a 0% concentration of the other colors. Likewise, the color green would have an RGB value of (0, 255, 0) and the color blue would have an RGB value of (0, 0, 255). 

            <br><br>

            We'll be using colors from the rainbow for this tutorial. If you'd like to choose different colors, you can <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_rgb.asp" target="_blank">experiment with an RGB calculator to make custom colors</a> or <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_rgb.asp" target="_blank">copy and paste the RGB codes for some common colors</a>.

            <br><br>

            To use the rainbow colors, copy and paste this Python code into your <em>hearts.py</em> file, under the code we have already written. Remember, the lines of code that begin with the # sign will not be run. We're using this feature to make a note of what colors the RGB values will create.

            <div class="well well-sm">
                <em># Create variables to hold each RGB color we want to use</em>

                <br><br>
                <em># red</em><br>
                r = (255, 0, 0)

                <br><br>
                <em># pink</em><br>
                p = (204, 0, 204)

                <br><br>
                <em># orange</em><br>
                o = (255, 128, 0)

                <br><br>
                <em># yellow</em><br>
                y = (255, 255, 0)

                <br><br>
                <em># green</em><br>
                g = (0, 255, 0)

                <br><br>
                <em># aqua</em><br>
                a = (0, 255, 255)

                <br><br>
                <em># blue</em><br>
                b = (0, 0, 255)

                <br><br>
                <em># purple</em><br>
                pr = (128, 0, 255)

                <br><br>
                <em># empty (no color)</em><br>
                e = (0, 0, 0)
