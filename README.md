# Rainbow Hearts
Using your Raspberry Pi and SenseHAT, make hearts appear on the LED matrix in a variety of colors!

## What You Need
This tutorial assumes you have the following:

* A Raspberry Pi (from here forward, referred to as "RPi")
* A SenseHAT, which is connected to the RPi's GPIO pins
* **Either** SSH access to your RPi
* **Or** an external monitor connected to your RPi with an HDMI cable, and a mouse & keyboard connected to your RPi
* The correct power adapter

Verify that everything is working properly
* If the LEDs on your SenseHAT lit up in a rainbow when you connected the RPi to power, it's working!
* Boot up the RPi. If you are using a monitor, you should see either the Desktop or Bash, depending on whether you're using the GUI or not.
